# The best emojis for business and work in general

Hi everyone ![:wave:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=12),

Emojis are not only for young teenagers on Instagram, they are also great to emphasize content or convey information. Don’t we say a picture is worth a thousand words? In Asana, you can add emojis by typing « : » then a word in a task description or comment. But that doesn’t work in task names, project names, team names or custom fields. Here is the little trick to get an emoji keyboard almost anywhere: Ctrl+Cmd+Space on Mac OS, and Windows+. on Windows (or right click, and select “Emoji”)!

Below is a list of emojis and their possible meaning in a work environment. I encourage you to use them as a prefix in team names, project names, task names if that makes sense, and as options in drop-down custom fields!

![:rotating_light:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rotating_light.png?v=12) Because discourse does not have all the emojis Mac OS has, I am pasting screenshots and not the actual emojis. You can easily find them all in your emojis keyboard.

Do you have other cool emojis in mind?

Wow we could have made a post together ![:heart_eyes:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=12)thanks!

[@Bastien_Siebman](https://forum.asana.com/u/bastien_siebman) & [@lpb](https://forum.asana.com/u/lpb) Great work guys, this is awesome. I always struggle with how to best make use of Visuals and especially emoji’s…

Jason.

Great [@Bastien_Siebman](https://forum.asana.com/u/bastien_siebman)  
Just to complete the tips, you have 2 different solutions with Windows:

  * Right click, and select “Emoji”
  * Or use the keyboard shortcut "Windows+.“ (you wrote semicolon but it’s actually point ![:wink:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12))



Good contribution [@Bastien_Siebman](https://forum.asana.com/u/bastien_siebman).  
Personally I am not very loving emojis in task managers. Maybe it’s because of a form factor, I mean, I love emojis but to communicate in messaging applications.

For professional environments, they are a great visual aid, but I get a lot of variety of shapes and colors.

Maybe I would think differently if you had the option of putting linear icons.  
The only symbols I use in asana are star-shaped characters to indicate the level of concentration that some tasks may require.

A pleasure to read you

Greetings from Barcelona and best wishes for 2020

Thanks [@Julien_RENAUD](https://forum.asana.com/u/julien_renaud) for the fix about Windows, I updated my post!

[@JMartinez](https://forum.asana.com/u/jmartinez) I can definitely understand, even though I do believe they bring fun to work. Asana without any emoji is very “serious” and not fun tu work with. The star idea is a good one!

I just came across this helpful post (though it’s from 2017) and wanted to include it in this thread in case of use:

The one thing I would just say is we need some diverse emojis, 2020 and still nothing on Twitter! ![:-1:t4:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/-1/4.png?v=12)![:woman_shrugging:t4:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/woman_shrugging/4.png?v=12)

On Mac OS at least each emoji is available in various skin colors, isn’t that what you need?

I’m an Android/ PC user. I think this was updated though.

Thanks for this interesting information!
