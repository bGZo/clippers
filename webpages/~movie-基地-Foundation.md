若问历史学家 “人类最伟大的发明是什么 ”，火、车轮、刀剑，我会说是历史本身。历史不是一种事实，而是一种故事 精心策划和塑造的故事，在合适的人笔下，恶棍能变成英雄，谎言能变成真理。

Ask a historian, "What was mankind's greatest invention?" Fire? The wheel? The sword? I would argue it's history itself. History isn't fact. It's narrative, one carefully curated and shaped. Under the pen strokes of the right scribe, a villain becomes a hero, a lie becomes the truth.
