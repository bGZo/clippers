在今年七月号的[《The Wire》](http://www.thewire.co.uk/)杂志上看到这篇[「到底什么是 New Age」](http://livelifeletlive.blogspot.com/2010/12/what-is-new-age-anyway-by-jack-clarke.html)被印成背景图案了。[New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age)……好遥远的词汇啊。

It's people who believe we are what we think we are, and can change ourselves by changing our thinking.

It's people that feel they can change the world by changing themselves, not by trying to change others.

It's people that choose their own path rather than follow dogma.

It's people interested in owning themselves rather than things.

It's people curious about extra sensory perception and all it implies.

It's people in all walks of life, from business persons to flower essence healers, psychologists to UFO investigators.
