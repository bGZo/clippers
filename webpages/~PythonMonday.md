If you want to learn how to write computer programs, you have come to the right place, every Monday I'll be posting a single page of a book that I hope to write with you about computer programming. Together we are going to explore why writing programs is a political act, and we'll learn how to write programs using the Python Programming Language.

If there is any specific topic within programming that you would like to learn, send me an email at DamianTGordon(a)gmail.com and we'll work together on that topic.
