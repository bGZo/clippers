Dear Sir,

Thank you for expressing your interest in offering me a place as a girlfriend. However, due to the large amount of

love confessions

I received this year, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your confession at this time.

Please be aware that this rejection does not reflect any negative evaluation on your confession. This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of love confessions. With such a varied and promising result, it is impossible for me to accept all confessions, regardless of their outstanding confessing performances.

Again, I greatly appreciate your interest in loving me, and I offer my best wishes of success in your future love confession.

Best,

XXX
