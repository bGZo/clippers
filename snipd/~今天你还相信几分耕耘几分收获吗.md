title: 【随机波动159】今天你还相信几分耕耘几分收获吗
type: podcast-episode
---


## Show notes
> 六年前我们与图书编辑罗丹妮做过一期关于做书与读书的节目，时光荏苒，在《格》和「随机图书馆」系列问世之后，当我们仨获得新书作者的身份，我们对于今天的出版与书也产生了很多新的疑问：书还重要吗？买书重要吗？如今的读者是谁，他们又在哪里？我们与他们要如何在屏幕和书之间分配时间呢？
> 
> 
> 本期随机波动，我们邀请了丹妮姐和漫画编辑、梦药水创始人猫弟做客节目。五个近期都编了、做了、出了新书的人，尝试共同面对这个读者也是用户、书籍亦是产品的新时代。
> 
> 
> 乍看起来，丹妮和猫弟有着传统内容编辑与新型产品经理的类型差别，其实二人都置身于这条名为出版的河流之中，感受着水温与方向的复杂变化。她们眼前不只是书，更多还是人——如果编辑没有对现代人的变化的理解和接受，书又要做给谁读呢？阅读行为又如何可能呢？如果不基于与作者、与出版其他环节参与者的信任和协作，过程与结果的逻辑、耕耘和收获的关联又要如何建立起来？
> 
> 
> 做书，是一份她们热爱的工作，是在一个努力工作可能被嘲弄奚落的时代里的坚持，也是一条“在被世界吞噬的恐惧中保全自己”的路径。
> 
> 
> 关于阅读的未来，我们没有答案。唯一确定的是，人不能没有书。

I still want to find those people. This is not a big change. So in a具体 of writing, for example, the book is also a set of 或者是文案也好 或者是作为编辑 去跟读者沟通的那个方式 我一直没有太大变化 包括语言上的使用 但是到底怎么样去寻所到这些人 以及我真的能说服他们 这是那本他们在寻找的书这件事情其实就是市场我理解 So I feel like the Market is the market. It's like a business and a shopping business. And I can find these people. And they're in the same way. So if a book's book doesn't understand. I feel like it's a bit normal. 因为分众太厉害了 然后大家被各种各样的信息淹没 我自己也是这样 所以有时候我就在想如何让我的声音和信息很清楚 很准确 又在恰当的时候让对方获取到 这件事情变得是一个 非常复杂的事。 So I understand that it is this way.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>傅适野</b>

I think that's a point I'm feeling very close to the audience. First you will call the reader as a user. You will say my user is what is the user. Then you will call the book or read the book. This is a way of being a cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural. Then you will say, if you look at a show, you will say, you will say, you offer this product, and you have your own business. And your target user is the other cultural and cultural and cultural and cultural. Yeah. I think it's a We're,我们究竟在关心什么话题?</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>猫弟</b>

我觉得这个是很有意思的一个点,就是可不可以展开讲一讲, 你认为我们今天如果存在一个所谓的时代精神,时代情绪或者时代什么 我觉得我可能说不了就是时代精神是什么东西, 我可以再说一说就是我会有这个观点的想法, I think. I'm not a teacher. I'm not a teacher. I'm not a teacher. I like to watch the脱口秀. I watch the展覽. I watch other kinds of cultural media. So I think. From the time. I'm going to put my time. I'm going to give these different areas. 那我感觉其他的读者大量的读者其实也是一样的在他们不读书的时候他们可能在听音乐听播客看电影 所以我就会觉得那图书的发展跟其他的行业是不是保持一致的 因为其实图书可能它更传统,有更多的环节 所以有的时候我们在做书的时候就会按照过去大家是这么做的 然后就继续这样做 我是有这样的想法 然后很巧的是今天就是我在听《罗斯在宁井》嘛 听完以后我就去看了一下评论 我发现有一个读者说了一段温特森的一段话 is I don't want to see the book and the book and the book, and the book and the book and the book, I'm 都想着我们的产品最后看起来是什么样并不重要 反正一定有读者的 那就有一点危险了 这是一种顾不自封的态度 不 我们没有必要到外面去创造新的读者群 那些CD或影碟或电影院的消费者通常不读书 这种态度就像是说 He said 不热爱书籍的人永远都不会热爱 所以我们就不需要在意他们了 可是我非常在意 我认为你需要搭建桥梁 去帮助人们简简单单地打开一本书 开始阅读 因为一旦他们这么做了你就成功了一 因为一旦他们这么做了你就成功了一半 我觉得你可以去帮助人们 也许有的人只是有一点害怕书 哪怕在多媒体时代 语言文字也有自己的力量 不习惯于文字的人可能会有一点被他震慑到 尤其是如果他们没有接受特定的教育 他们成长过程中并没有书籍的陪伴 所以他们会觉得书籍不是为他们而存在的 你需要帮助他们意识到 。 I think I think I can to express my feelings.

But if you go to a large book store, like the U.S. Or the four or five different cities, you know we have a lot of books, or in five years there are very many books, but it's not prepared to sell. 直到今天有大量的书他是拒绝进入市场的他是不进入这个市场进行竞争的所以我自己觉得这几年我们感受到最大的困难事实上应该是一个书他作为一种商品他的利润完全不能够保障这个行业的良性发展的问题而这个问题事实上不是我们今天在这里能够简单讲清楚的 It's not prepared It is a product that is a A product that is product In this context, I think we should be more careful about this topic. It's not a change. It's always a product for a product. The main issue is that when it becomes a product, it should be worth its value. This is what we mentioned earlier.
