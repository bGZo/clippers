title: 【随机波动117】狗屁规则，狗屁官僚，狗屁世界
type: podcast-episode
---


## Show notes
> 在这个毕业季、高考季，我们想跟大家聊一个关于考试、工作，关于一个初入社会的年轻人如何被一个吃人的庞大系统吞噬的故事。
> 
> 
> 在过去几周里，我们三个先后读了人类学家大卫·格雷伯最新的中文译著《规则的悖论：想象背后的技术、愚笨与权力诱惑》，同时看了韩国导演郑朱莉的新片《下一个素熙》。在阅读和观影的过程中，我们发现二者构成了某种奇妙的互文。格雷伯对资本主义和官僚制鞭辟入里的分析，回答了电影没能回答的那个问题，为什么会出现素熙的悲剧，又为什么永远有下一个素熙；而电影所呈现的一个女孩在几个月时间里从心灵到肉体一点点死亡的故事，也反过来为格雷伯的论断提供了最好的例证，对他生前用研究和行动反对的那套制度提出了最决绝的控诉。
> 
> 
> 在这期节目中，我们试图把这本书和这部电影“交叉剪辑”在一起，以格雷伯的视角进入这部电影，也以素熙的视角重读了这本书。我们发现，素熙悲剧的始作俑者，既是以逐利为唯一目的、无限占有劳动者的时间、身体和情感的资本主义系统，也是冷漠、教条、用繁冗的表格文书管理一切的官僚制度。市场和官僚，这两个在今天的主流现象中背道而驰的概念，实际上你中有我、我中有你。而我们所有人都和素熙一样，生活在二者合谋编织的巨大的网络之下，透不过气。
